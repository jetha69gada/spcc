# # Note :
#   This program implements a two-pass assembler for a simple assembly language. The first pass generates the symbol table and literal table by iterating over the code and keeping track of the current location counter. The symbol table is a dictionary that maps symbols to memory addresses, and the literal table is a dictionary that maps literals to memory addresses. The second pass generates the object code by iterating over the code again and replacing symbols and literals with their corresponding memory addresses. The object code is returned as a string.

# To use the program, simply call first_pass() with the code to generate the symbol table and literal table, and then call second_pass() with the code to generate the object code. The example code provided demonstrates how the program can be used to assemble a simple program, where each instruction consists of an opcode followed by one or more operands, and where symbols are used to represent memory addresses.
