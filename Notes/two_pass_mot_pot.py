#  # Note:
# This program implements a two-pass assembler for a simple assembly language. The first pass generates the symbol table and literal table by iterating over the code and keeping track of the current location counter. The location counter is incremented based on the instruction type, which is determined by checking the instruction against the MOT and POT. The MOT (Machine Opcode Table) contains the opcodes for the machine instructions, and the POT (Pseudo Opcode Table) contains the opcodes for the assembler directives.

# The second pass generates the object code by iterating over the code again and replacing instructions and directives with their corresponding opcodes. The object code is returned as a string.

# To use the program, simply call first_pass() with the code to generate the symbol table and literal table, and then call second_pass() with the code to generate the object code. The example code provided demonstrates how the program can be used to assemble a simple program, where each instruction consists of an opcode followed by one or more operands, and where symbols are used to represent memory addresses. The program also displays the contents of the MOT and POT.
