# # Note : 
# This program implements a two-pass assembler for a simple assembly language. The first pass generates the base table and symbol table by iterating over the code and keeping track of the current location counter. The base table is a dictionary that maps base names to base addresses, and the symbol table is a dictionary that maps symbols to memory addresses. The second pass generates the object code by iterating over the code again and replacing symbols and bases with their corresponding memory addresses. The location counter is also updated as the object code is generated. The object code is returned as a string.

# To use the program, simply call first_pass() with the code to generate the base table and symbol table, and then call second_pass() with the code to generate the object code and update the location counter. The example code provided demonstrates how the program can be used to assemble a simple program, where each instruction consists of an opcode followed by one or more operands, and where bases and symbols are used to represent memory addresses.
